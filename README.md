# NeverLate

The goal of this project is to help you never be late. You put in your usual routes, and it tracks when you start and finish your trips. 
It looks at traffic, weather, and your past habits to predict when you should leave, and sends smart reminders so you get there on time. 
Over time, it learns your patterns, spots common traffic slowdowns, and shows simple stats about your commutes.
